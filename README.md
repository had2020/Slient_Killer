A Godot/Redot HTML Game

This is short for a school competion. Feel free to read through if that's your thing. It's just about the assigment.
It's also live on Itch https://had2023.itch.io/slient-killer, not just Github pages

## Our Vision

We want to open people’s eyes to an invisible threat—how environmental hazards are silently cutting our lives short, just like the black lung epidemic among coal miners. Our game sheds light on the dangers of **particulate matter**, **water pollution**, and the **recycling of contaminated crop water**. These issues often go unnoticed, but they’re affecting our health and longevity every day.

We believe that if people truly understood the risks, they’d be scared—and they should be. Not to panic, but to *act*. It's time to demand change from the polluters and protect our communities.

## Why It Matters

In our urban community, surrounded by highways and industry, the air we breathe and the water we drink aren't as safe as they should be. These environmental threats are shortening our lifespans—and most people don't even know it. Our goal is to change that through awareness and action.

## SMART Goal

We're launching a digital campaign to raise awareness of:

- Particulate matter (air pollution)
- Water contamination
- The risks of recycling polluted crop water

We’ll do this through an **interactive online game**, created in Godot/Redot, and promoted via **QR code flyers** around our school. Our target: **reach 50+ students** in a community of 400, sparking real-life conversations and spreading the message through **memes and social media**.

## Our Audience

Our primary audience is high school students in our city—surrounded by freeways, shaped by local infrastructure, and often unaware of the hidden dangers around them. But one thing we all understand? **Memes.**

## Our Strategy

We’ll hook our audience using **funny, thought-provoking memes** on flyers. Each QR code leads to our project’s website and game. The humor draws them in, the message makes them think, and the conversation keeps spreading.
